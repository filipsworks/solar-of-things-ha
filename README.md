## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL and select "Integration" as the category
6. Click "Install"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `solar_of_things` folder from this repository
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Finding Your Credentials

Before configuring the integration, you need to obtain your IOT Token, Station ID, and Device ID:

1. Log into [https://solar.siseli.com](https://solar.siseli.com)
2. Open your browser's developer tools (press F12)
3. Go to the **Network** tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look at the API requests (filter by "api" or "attribute")
6. Find and copy:
   - **IOT-Token**: Found in the request headers
   - **deviceId**: Found in request payloads (18-digit number)
   - **stationId**: Found in request payloads (18-digit number)

### Adding the Integration

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Solar of Things"
4. Enter your credentials:
   - **IOT Token** (required): Your authentication token
   - **Station ID** (required): Used to auto-discover all devices and enable monthly stats
   - **Device ID** (optional): If set, Home Assistant will only create entities for that one device

### Multiple Stations / Multiple Accounts

To add multiple stations:
1. Add the integration once for each station/device combination
2. Use different Device IDs for each
3. Each integration instance will create a separate device in Home Assistant

## Usage Examples

### Energy Dashboard

Add the following sensors to your Energy Dashboard:

- **Solar Production**: `sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_pv_input_power`
- **Grid Consumption**: `sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_grid_import_power`
- **Grid Return**: `sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_grid_feed_in_power`
- **Battery Charge**: `sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_battery_charging_current`
- **Battery Discharge**: `sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_battery_discharge_current`

### Automation Example

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify when battery is low"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_battery_state_of_charge
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Solar battery is low ({{ states('sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_battery_state_of_charge') }}%)"
```

### Lovelace Card Example

```yaml
type: entities
title: Solar System
entities:
  - entity: sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_pv_input_power
    name: Solar Generation
  - entity: sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_battery_state_of_charge
    name: Battery Level
  - entity: sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_load_power
    name: Current Load
  - entity: sensor.solar_station_xxxxx_grid_import_power
    name: Grid Import
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot Connect" Error

- Verify your IOT Token is correct and hasn't expired
- Check that your Device ID and Station ID are correct (18-digit numbers)
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Token may expire - get a fresh one from the Siseli portal

### No Data Showing

- Wait 5-10 minutes for the first data update
- Check the integration logs: Settings → System → Logs
- Verify your device is online and reporting data at solar.siseli.com

### Sensors Unavailable

- Check if the specific sensor is supported by your inverter model
- Some sensors may only be available during certain conditions (e.g., battery sensors when battery is active)
