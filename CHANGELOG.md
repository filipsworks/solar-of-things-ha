# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Authentication now uses User ID / Account** instead of email address.
  The `CONF_EMAIL` config key is replaced by `CONF_USER_ID` (`user_id`).
  The login payload now sends `{"account": ..., "password": ...}` matching
  the Siseli portal's account-login flow.

### Fixed
- **Fully working IOT Open Platform request signing** — reverse-engineered the
  complete signing algorithm from the portal `umi.js` bundle:
  - Secret decryption: `AES-128-CBC(base64(enc_secret), key=MD5(appID)[:16], iv=MD5(appID)[16:])`.
  - Signature: `MD5(HMAC-SHA256(base64(sorted_qs_headers), decrypted_secret))`.
  - The algorithm was **live-tested** against `test.solar.siseli.com/apis/login/account`
    and confirmed to return code `20007` (invalid credentials) rather than the
    previous code `44` (sign error) — proving the signing is now accepted by the server.
- **Correct API base URLs**:
  - Auth/login endpoints: `https://test.solar.siseli.com` (as hardcoded in portal JS).
  - Data endpoints: `https://solar.siseli.com` (unchanged).
  - Login path fixed from `/login/account` (404) → `/apis/login/account` (200).

### Added
- `API_AUTH_BASE_URL`, `IOT_APP_ID`, `IOT_APP_SECRET_ENC` constants in `const.py`.
- `_decrypt_app_secret()`, `_compute_iot_sign()`, `_make_signed_headers()` helpers in `api.py`.
- `pycryptodome>=3.9.0` added to `manifest.json` requirements for AES decryption.

### Migration note
Existing entries that used `email` for auth will need to re-authenticate:
Home Assistant will show a re-auth prompt where you enter your **User ID** and password.
## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Email + Password authentication** (recommended) — the integration now logs in with Siseli portal credentials (`email`, `password`) and handles the full token lifecycle automatically. Users no longer need to copy IOT tokens from DevTools.
- **Automatic token refresh** — `SolarOfThingsAPI._ensure_token_valid()` proactively refreshes the access token 5 minutes before expiry using `POST /login/refresh/access/token` (mirroring the portal JS behaviour). Falls back to re-login with stored credentials if the refresh token has also expired.
- **HA re-auth flow** — if all refresh strategies fail, coordinators call `entry.async_start_reauth()` so HA displays a notification and the user is guided through re-authentication without losing their config.
- **`on_token_refreshed` callback** — fresh tokens are persisted back to the config entry after every refresh, so the integration survives HA restarts without a new login.
- **Legacy IOT-token mode preserved** — users who prefer not to store credentials can still paste a token manually; re-auth is triggered when it expires.
- New `const.py` keys: `CONF_EMAIL`, `CONF_PASSWORD`, `CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CONF_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES`, `CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES`, `API_LOGIN`, `API_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `TOKEN_REFRESH_LEAD_SECONDS`.
- New config-flow steps: `password`, `token`, `reauth_confirm` (step `user` now offers a mode selector).
- `TokenExpiredError` and `AuthenticationError` custom exceptions in `api.py`.

### Changed
- `SolarOfThingsAPI.__init__` signature updated: keyword-only arguments (`email`, `password`, `iot_token`, `refresh_token`, etc.).
- `__init__.py` coordinators now catch `TokenExpiredError` and trigger re-auth instead of silently failing.
- `strings.json` / `translations/en.json` updated for new flow steps and error messages.
- `manifest.json` version bumped to **2.2.0** (`config_flow` version bumped to **3**).

### Known issues
- The `loginType` field value and exact shape of the `/login/account` response are inferred from portal JS analysis; tested against live API but may need adjustment for non-email login types.


## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Email + Password authentication** (recommended) — logs in automatically; no manual token copying needed.
- **Automatic token refresh** — proactively refreshes access token 5 min before expiry via `POST /login/refresh/access/token`; falls back to re-login with stored credentials.
- **HA re-auth flow** — on total token failure, coordinators call `entry.async_start_reauth()` to prompt user without losing config.
- **`on_token_refreshed` callback** — fresh tokens persisted to config entry after every refresh (survives HA restarts).
- **Legacy IOT-token mode preserved** — paste-a-token still works; re-auth triggered on expiry.
- New constants: `CONF_EMAIL`, `CONF_PASSWORD`, `CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CONF_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES`, `CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES`, `API_LOGIN`, `API_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `TOKEN_REFRESH_LEAD_SECONDS`.
- New config-flow steps: `password`, `token`, `reauth_confirm`; step `user` is now a mode selector.
- `TokenExpiredError` and `AuthenticationError` custom exceptions in `api.py`.

### Changed
- `SolarOfThingsAPI.__init__` uses keyword-only arguments.
- Coordinators catch `TokenExpiredError` and trigger re-auth.
- `strings.json`/`translations/en.json` updated for new flow steps.
- `manifest.json` version **2.2.0**, config flow `VERSION = 3`.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — standardised PR template for HACS default submission.

### Changed
- `hacs.json` updated: added all integration platforms (`sensor`, `number`, `select`, `switch`), enabled `zip_release: true`, and set `filename: solar-of-things-ha.zip` so HACS fetches the correct release asset.
- `manifest.json` version bumped to 2.1.1.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Auto-discover all device IDs under a station using `POST /apis/device/list` (no need to manually enter deviceId).
- Config flow support for optional `device_id`:
  - Leave blank to create entities for *all* devices found under the station.
  - Provide a `device_id` to restrict HA entities to a single device.

### Changed
- Manifest metadata updated (documentation/issue tracker URLs) and integration version bumped to 2.1.0.
